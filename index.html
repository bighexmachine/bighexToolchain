      <h1>How to compile and run a program written in X.</h1>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li>You need to have GCC or another C compiler installed.<br>
        <li>Tutorial will be written using linux commands. There will be similar commands and tools for your own operating system.<br>
      </ul>
    
      <h2>How to Compile</h2>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Download and extract this <a href="xResources.zip">zip file</a> containing the tools you will need.<br>

        <li>Compile 32bitSimulatorForBinaryImage.c with <span>gcc 32bitSimulatorForBinaryImage.c</span> or using your favourite compiler.<br>

        <li>Copy the X compiler binary to a.bin with <span>cp x_to_16bitHex_compiler.bin a.bin</span><br>

        <li>Run the simulator executable streaming the x source code in to standard input with <span>./a.out < io.x</span>. This will produce two files: sim2 and sim3. These are the hex input for the machine.<br>

        <li>Now compile 16bitSimulatorForHexImages.c with <span>gcc 16bitSimulatorForHexImages.c</span>.<br>

        <li>Run the compiled executable with <span>./a.out</span>.
      </ol>
    
    <h2>How to Run the Executable</h2>
    
    There are four options on where to run your executable:
    
    <ol>
    	<li>Via C: You can execute the code via the C Simulator as outlined in steps 5 and 6 above.
    	<li>Via Java: You can execute the code via ModuleSim. The latest version of ModuleSim can be downloaded via our <a href = "https://github.com/uobteachingtechnologist/ModuleSim/releases">releases pages</a>.
    		The ModuleSim files for the BigHex Machine can also be found via a <a href = "https://github.com/bighexmachine/BigHexModuleSim">Github Repo</a>.
    	<li>Via Javascript: We have a <a href = "https://bighexmachine.github.io/JavascriptSimulator/">Javascript Simulator</a> for the BigHex Machine.
    	<li>Via the BigHex Machine itself: You can find it in the Merchant Venturers Building.
    </ol>
